# Project 0: Google Search Clone

## Description
This project is a simplified front-end replica of Google's search interface, built as part of a school assignment. It includes three main pages:
- **Google Search Page** (`index.html`): A search form that redirects to Google search results.
- **Google Image Search Page** (`image_search.html`): A search form specifically designed for Google Images.
- **Google Advanced Search Page** (`advanced_search.html`): A form that allows users to perform detailed searches using various criteria.

## Features
- **Google Search Page**: 
  - A centered search bar with rounded corners.
  - A "Google Search" button styled similarly to Google's.
  - Navigation links to the Image Search and Advanced Search pages.
- **Image Search Page**: 
  - A search bar for images with a hidden field (`tbm=isch`) to specify image searches.
  - Colorful, Google-style text for the heading.
  - Navigation links to the Home and Advanced Search pages.
- **Advanced Search Page**:
  - Four input fields to search for pages with all words, an exact phrase, any words, or none of these words.
  - A submit button styled to look like Google's "Advanced Search" button.
  - Navigation links to the Home and Image Search pages.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to start using the search interface.
2. Type your query into the search bar and click "Google Search" to see results.
3. Use the navigation links to access the Image Search or Advanced Search pages.
4. On the Image Search page, type a query to search Google Images.
5. On the Advanced Search page, fill in the fields to customize your search.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the pages.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and layout, including Flexbox for centering and color classes to mimic Google's look.
